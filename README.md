We have multiple options to build a resume, but building your resume with more precision one may use combination of CSS & HTML then later on convert it into PDF. Issue is that when one searches online then it is very difficult to find a free tool which converts your HTML & CSS into pdf which got their text editable. All of the implementation online at present which converts your HTML & CSS into pdf uses a method which converts the browser preview of HTML & CSS into an image then later on converts it into image format of pdf

Cons ?
Your resume cannot be read by ATS which majorly depends on text format of pdf to search the relevant keywords --> hence it's not usable

ResumeConverter will help you generating a pdf file which generates text based pdf format which is ATS friendly
